#Notes Lecture 02 | Installing Ubuntu
##What is Virtualization?
* Replication of hardware to simulate a virtual machine inside a physical machine.
* Two general types of virtualization:
  * server-side virtualization
  * client-side virtualization
* The difference between the two is where the virtualizing takes place

##Server-side virtualization 
###Virtual Desktop Infrastructure(VDI)
* Thick client or fat client
* Think client 
* Zero client 
##Client-side virtualization
* Software installed on a computer to manage virtual machines
* Each VM has its own operating system installed
* For client-side virtualization, the computer needs:
  * A hypervisor (software that allows the management of virtual machines)
  * Hardware support
* Capable CPU
* Enough RAM
* Enough Storage
##Benefits of Virtualization
* Allows running multiple OSs on one machine 
* Allows applications to be tested before installing them on a host machine
* Reduces cost by decreasing the physical hardware that must be purchased for a network
* Offers the chance to experiment with untested programs without infecting host machines with viruses or other malware
##Installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine
* Download the iso file
* Click on new and enter a name for the virtual machine
* Select an OS type
* Select the desired memory size
* Select storage type
* Select file location and size 
* Start!
