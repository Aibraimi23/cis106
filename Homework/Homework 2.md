#Homework 2 | Research free software/open source software alternatives.

##Part 1

###What are the advantages of open source?
- Software is free
- Source code is open to the public for changes
- Many closed source software have open source alternatives

###What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
- Users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, change and improve the software.

###Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version? 
- I think people should use open source instead of the proprietary version because users have more control over what they want to do. Also they are able to modify the software in any way they see fit to add or remove certain things.

###Do you agree with Richard Stallman? 
- I 100% agree with Richard Stallman. As he said "Users control the software" is great, you never have to worry about not liking something about a program, you can always change it to your liking. Anyone who chooses to make a change or modify any part of the software is free to do so, you'll never have to worry about developers telling you, that you can't change any part of it.
